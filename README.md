# CS320-SoftwareTesting

In completing Project One and Project Two, I developed a deeper understanding of how to ensure that software is both functional and secure. I accomplished this by writing unit tests to verify the correctness of my code and catch potential errors early in the development cycle. By validating inputs, throwing exceptions for invalid data, and designing test cases that simulate various user scenarios, I created more robust and reliable components. These testing strategies are essential not only for catching bugs but also for identifying potential vulnerabilities, making the software more secure.

Understanding user needs played a critical role throughout the development process. I interpreted user requirements by analyzing provided specifications and translating them into functional features. I ensured these features aligned with the goals of the program through iterative testing and updates. Incorporating feedback into the code—whether by refining how data is handled or ensuring that test cases reflect real-world scenarios—was key to delivering a program that met expectations.

When designing software, I begin by breaking the project into smaller, manageable components. For example, I defined clear responsibilities for each class, such as separating the logic in ContactService from the data structure in Contact. I rely on principles like modularity, simplicity, and reusability, and I plan for testing from the start. This approach helped me develop not only working code but also code that is easier to maintain and scale. These projects have reinforced the importance of combining thoughtful design with thorough testing to ensure software quality.
